echo "=========================="
echo "1. ✅ VM zsh shell saves current directory on exit"
echo "2. ✅ Only saves if inside workspace (/workspace/*)"
echo "3. ✅ Calculates relative path from workspace root"
echo "4. ✅ Host reads saved directory after SSH exit"
echo "5. ✅ Host changes to corresponding directory if it exists"
echo "6. ✅ No-op if exited outside workspace (safety feature)"
echo ""
echo "🚀 To use: Just run 'vm ssh', navigate in VM, exit, and you'll be in the same relative directory on the host!"
