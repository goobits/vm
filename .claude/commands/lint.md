Deploy AI agents to improve work quality efficiently and safely.

## Core Rules
1. **Don't break anything** - Test changes before applying
2. **Simple fixes first** - Start with obvious improvements
3. **Work in parallel** - Multiple agents on different tasks
4. **Stop if unsure** - When in doubt, ask for review

## Agent Roles
- **Coordinator** - Assigns work, prevents conflicts
- **Analyzer** - Finds issues and improvement opportunities
- **Fixer** - Makes improvements based on risk level
- **Validator** - Checks that changes are safe

## Risk Levels
- **Safe** (auto-fix): Formatting, whitespace, naming
- **Low Risk** (batch & test): Remove duplicates, organize structure
- **High Risk** (careful review): Logic changes, major refactoring

## Process
1. **Scan** - Find all improvement opportunities
2. **Sort** - Group by risk level
3. **Fix** - Start with safe changes, move to risky ones
4. **Verify** - Ensure nothing broke

## Success Metrics
- No functionality broken
- Measurable quality improvement
- Completed within time/resource limits
- Can run again without issues

**Goal**: Make systematic improvements quickly and safely.
