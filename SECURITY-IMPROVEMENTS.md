# Docker Security Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the security improvements made to remove dangerous Docker privileges that created container escape risks.

## Issues Identified

The VM tool was using several dangerous Docker configurations that created significant security vulnerabilities:

### 1. Excessive Privileges (`--privileged` flag)
- **Location**: `vm-temp.sh` line 340
- **Risk**: Privileged mode gives containers unrestricted access to the host system
- **Impact**: Complete container escape capability, full host system access

### 2. Dangerous Capabilities (`--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE`)
- **Location**: `providers/docker/docker-provisioning-simple.sh` line 245
- **Risk**: SYS_PTRACE allows debugging and tracing of host processes
- **Impact**: Process manipulation, potential privilege escalation

### 3. Disabled Security (`--security-opt seccomp=unconfined`)
- **Location**: `providers/docker/docker-provisioning-simple.sh` line 247
- **Risk**: Removes syscall filtering protection
- **Impact**: Unrestricted system call access, bypass of security boundaries

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Removed Privileged Mode
**File**: `vm-temp.sh`
```yaml
# BEFORE (DANGEROUS):
privileged: true

# AFTER (SECURE):
# Security: Removed privileged mode - creates container escape risks
cap_add:
  - CHOWN        # Change file ownership (needed for development file operations)
  - SETUID       # Set user ID (needed for sudo and user switching)  
  - SETGID       # Set group ID (needed for proper group permissions)
```

### 2. Replaced Dangerous Capabilities with Minimal Required Ones
**File**: `providers/docker/docker-provisioning-simple.sh`
```yaml
# BEFORE (DANGEROUS):
cap_add:
  - SYS_PTRACE
security_opt:
  - seccomp:unconfined

# AFTER (SECURE):
cap_add:
  - CHOWN        # Change file ownership (needed for development file operations)
  - SETUID       # Set user ID (needed for sudo and user switching)
  - SETGID       # Set group ID (needed for proper group permissions)
# Note: Default seccomp profile remains enabled for security
```

### 3. Maintained Development Functionality
The following capabilities were retained to ensure development workflows continue to work:

- **CHOWN**: Required for changing file ownership during development operations
- **SETUID**: Needed for sudo functionality and user switching within containers
- **SETGID**: Required for proper group permission management

## Security Benefits

1. **Container Escape Prevention**: Removed privileged mode eliminates the primary vector for container escapes
2. **Process Isolation**: Removed SYS_PTRACE prevents debugging of host processes
3. **Syscall Filtering**: Maintained default seccomp profile provides protection against dangerous system calls
4. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only granted minimal capabilities actually needed for development

## Functionality Preserved

The security improvements maintain all essential development functionality:

- File operations and ownership management
- User switching and sudo access
- Development server operation
- Docker-in-Docker access (read-only socket mount)
- Database and service management
- SSH access and terminal functionality

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Before | After | Improvement |
|---------------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Container Escape | **HIGH** | **LOW** | Removed privileged mode |
| Process Manipulation | **HIGH** | **MINIMAL** | Removed SYS_PTRACE |
| Syscall Bypass | **HIGH** | **MINIMAL** | Enabled seccomp filtering |
| Overall Security | **POOR** | **GOOD** | Significant improvement |

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Periodically review container configurations for security regressions
2. **Capability Monitoring**: Monitor if additional capabilities are needed and document justification
3. **User Education**: Educate developers on secure container practices
4. **Testing**: Verify that development workflows continue to function with reduced privileges

## Files Modified

1. `/workspace/providers/docker/docker-provisioning-simple.sh` - Main Docker configuration
2. `/workspace/vm-temp.sh` - Temporary VM configuration
3. `/workspace/SECURITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md` - This documentation

## Validation

To validate these changes:

1. Test VM creation: `vm create`
2. Test temporary VM: `vm temp ./src`
3. Verify file operations work correctly
4. Confirm sudo access functions properly
5. Test development server functionality

All development workflows should continue to function normally while providing significantly improved security posture.
