## Purpose

This proposal tests the **complete beginner onboarding experience** for developers who have:
- ‚ùå No Rust toolchain installed
- ‚ùå No Docker installed
- ‚ùå No prior knowledge of the VM tool

## Related Tests

This is **Path 1** of 3 onboarding tests:

- ‚úÖ **Proposal 15:** Complete Beginner (this test)
- üîÑ **Proposal 16:** Quick Start Developer (has Rust/Docker)
- üîÑ **Proposal 17:** CI/CD Automated (scripted setup)

**Compare results across all three paths to identify:**
- Which prerequisites cause the most friction
- Whether "zero config" works in practice
- If documentation serves all user levels
- Where automation can improve UX
