# End-to-End Workflow Validation Report

This report documents the results of the end-to-end workflow validation tests as outlined in `11_PROPOSAL_E2E_WORKFLOW_VALIDATION.md`.

## 1. üöÄ Fresh Installation Test

**Goal**: Verify clean install on a fresh Linux (Ubuntu) environment.

**Result**: ‚ùå **FAIL (initially), then ‚úÖ PASS (with manual intervention)**

### Initial Attempt

The initial attempt to run `./install.sh --build-from-source` failed repeatedly. The build process would terminate at the final linking stage without a clear error message.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1.  **Missing System Dependencies**: The installation environment was missing the `build-essential` package and `clang`, which are required for linking Rust applications. The `install.sh` script did not check for or install these dependencies, leading to a build failure.
2.  **Insufficient Logging**: The `vm-installer` binary, which is called by the `install.sh` script, was not properly initializing its `tracing` subscriber. This caused all error messages to be suppressed, making it difficult to diagnose the root cause of the failure.

### Corrective Actions

1.  **Installed System Dependencies**: Manually installed the required build tools:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential clang
    ```
2.  **Enabled Installer Logging**: Modified the `vm-installer` to initialize its logging subscriber, which provided clearer error messages during the build process.
    - Added `vm-logging` to `rust/vm-installer/Cargo.toml`.
    - Called `init_subscriber()` in `rust/vm-installer/src/main.rs`.

### Final Result

After implementing the corrective actions, the installation succeeded. The `vm` command is now available in the PATH and responds correctly.

**Recommendation**: The `install.sh` script should be updated to check for and, if necessary, prompt the user to install the required system build dependencies for the target platform. This will prevent installation failures on fresh systems.

## 2. üê≥ VM Lifecycle Test

**Goal**: Validate basic VM operations work end-to-end.

**Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è  **PARTIAL PASS**

### Successful Operations

The core VM lifecycle commands executed successfully after manual intervention:
- `vm init`
- `vm create`
- `vm start`
- `vm status`
- `vm list`
- `vm stop`
- `vm destroy`

### Issues Found

1.  **`vm init` Resource Allocation Bug**: The `vm init` command created a `vm.yaml` that requested 6 CPUs, but the test environment only had 4 available. This caused the initial `vm create` command to fail.
    - **Workaround**: Manually edited `vm.yaml` to request 2 CPUs.
    - **Recommendation**: `vm init` should detect the host's available resources and generate a configuration that is valid for the environment.

2.  **`vm ssh` Command Execution Bug**: The `vm ssh -c <command>` feature is non-functional. It incorrectly parses the command as a file path, leading to a "No such file or directory" error. This prevents scripted command execution inside the VM.
    - **Workaround**: None. This is a critical bug that blocks scripted interactions with the VM.
    - **Recommendation**: Fix the argument parsing for the `vm ssh -c` command.

3.  **Verbose Logging in User Output**: The output of several `vm` commands is cluttered with structured logging data (e.g., `request{...}`). This information appears to be intended for debugging and should not be part of the standard user-facing output.
    - **Recommendation**: Configure the logging system to separate user-facing output from internal structured logs.

4.  **Docker Permissions**: The `vm create` command failed with a "permission denied" error when connecting to the Docker socket.
    - **Workaround**: Changed the permissions of `/var/run/docker.sock` to `666`. In a real-world scenario, the user would need to be added to the `docker` group.
    - **Recommendation**: The documentation should clearly state the requirement for the user to be in the `docker` group.

5.  **Non-Standard Build Directory**: The project uses a non-standard `.build/` directory at the project root for build artifacts, which is not a typical location for Cargo projects.
    - **Recommendation**: This should be clearly documented for developers to avoid confusion when looking for compiled binaries.

## 3. üì¶ Package Manager Test

**Goal**: Verify package installation works for `cargo`, `npm`, and `pip`.

**Result**: ‚ùå **BLOCKED**

### Execution

A VM was created with the following `packages` configuration in `vm.yaml`:
```yaml
packages:
  cargo:
    - ripgrep
  npm:
    - prettier
  pip:
    - black
```
The `vm create` logs indicated that the installation commands for each package manager were executed during the provisioning phase.

### Blocking Issue

This test is blocked by the critical bug in the `vm ssh -c <command>` functionality, which prevents programmatic verification of the installed packages inside the VM.

**Recommendation**: This test must be re-run after the `vm ssh -c` command is fixed.

---

## 4. üîÑ Multi-Instance Test

**Goal**: Verify multiple VMs can coexist and operate independently.

**Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è  **PARTIAL PASS**

### Execution

1.  Created two separate project directories: `project-a` and `project-b`.
2.  Ran `vm init` in each directory, which successfully created `vm.yaml` files with distinct port ranges.
3.  Manually edited the `vm.yaml` files to have a valid CPU count (2 CPUs).
4.  Ran `vm create --force && vm start` in each project directory. Both commands succeeded, and two separate Docker containers (`project-a-dev` and `project-b-dev`) were created and started.
5.  The `vm list` command correctly displayed both instances as running.

### Blocking Issue

The final verification step, which involves using `vm ssh -c "echo 'Project A'"` to confirm that each instance is a separate environment, is blocked by the critical bug in the `vm ssh -c` command.

**Recommendation**: While the basic creation of multiple instances appears to work, the inability to programmatically interact with them prevents a full validation of their isolation. This test should be re-run after the `vm ssh -c` bug is resolved.

---

## 5. üé® Framework Detection Test

**Goal**: Verify auto-detection of project types.

**Result**: ‚úÖ **PASS**

### Execution

1.  **React**: Created a new React project using `npx create-react-app react-test`. Running `vm init` in the directory correctly identified the framework as `react`.
2.  **Rust**: Created a new Rust project using `cargo new rust-test`. Running `vm init` correctly identified the framework as `rust`.
3.  **Python/Flask**: Created a directory with a `requirements.txt` file containing `flask`. Running `vm init` correctly identified the framework as `flask`.

### Conclusion

The framework detection feature is working as expected for all tested frameworks.

---

## 6. üîÑ File Sync / Hot Reload Test

**Goal**: Verify file changes on the host are reflected in the VM.

**Result**: üüß **BLOCKED**

### Observations

- The VM for this test (`sync-test`) was created successfully.
- However, this test is fundamentally blocked by the critical bug in `vm ssh -c <command>`.
- The test requires creating a file on the host, then using `vm ssh -c "ls /path/to/file"` to verify its existence inside the VM. It also requires the reverse: creating a file inside the VM and verifying it on the host.
- Without a working `vm ssh -c`, these verification steps are impossible.

**Recommendation**: This test is blocked until the `vm ssh -c` bug is resolved.

---

## 7. üîå Port Forwarding Test

**Goal**: Verify that ports are correctly forwarded from the VM to the host.

**Result**: ‚ùå **FAIL**

### Execution

1.  Created a simple Node.js/Express web server project designed to listen on port `3000`.
2.  Configured `vm.yaml` to forward guest port `3000` to host port `3000`.
3.  Added a `provision` step to install `npm` dependencies and start the server.
4.  Created the VM using `vm create`.

### Issues Found

1.  **Configuration Caching/Path Bug**: The `vm create` command repeatedly failed due to an incorrect CPU count, even though the `vm.yaml` file in the current directory was correct. It appears the `vm` tool was using a stale or cached configuration from a different location.
    - **Workaround**: Explicitly running `vm config set vm.cpus 2` forced the tool to recognize the correct configuration.
    - **Recommendation**: The CLI's configuration loading mechanism is buggy and needs to be fixed. It should reliably load the `vm.yaml` from the current project directory.

2.  **Port Forwarding Configuration Ignored**: The primary goal of the test failed. The `docker ps` command revealed that the port mapping defined in `vm.yaml` (`host: 3000, guest: 3000`) was completely ignored. Only the automatically allocated port range was mapped, and the web server was inaccessible from the host.
    - **Recommendation**: This is a critical bug. The `vm` tool must be fixed to correctly apply the port forwarding rules specified in the `ports` section of `vm.yaml`.
