# Goobits VM Architecture

## Overview

Goobits VM is built using a **layered architecture** designed around the principles of separation of concerns, dependency injection, and circular dependency elimination. The architecture promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability by organizing functionality into distinct crates with clear responsibilities and well-defined interfaces.

### Key Architectural Goals

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each crate has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Dependency Flow Control**: Dependencies flow in one direction, preventing circular dependencies
- **Provider Abstraction**: Multiple VM providers (Docker, Vagrant, Tart) through a unified interface
- **Error Consistency**: Unified error handling across all components
- **Testability**: Modular design enables comprehensive testing at all levels

- Hardware detection and reporting

**Key Exports**: Platform detection, system utilities, resource monitoring

#### vm-package-manager
**Role**: Package manager integration and link detection.

## Error Handling Philosophy

Goobits VM employs a **unified error handling strategy** centered around the `VmError` enum defined in `vm-core`. This approach ensures consistent error reporting and handling across all components.

### Core Principles

1. **Single Error Type**: All errors throughout the system are represented as `VmError` variants
2. **Contextual Information**: Errors include rich context about what operation failed and why
3. **User-Friendly Messages**: Error messages are crafted for end-user consumption
4. **Structured Handling**: Different error types enable appropriate handling strategies

### Error Categories

- **`Config`**: Configuration validation and parsing errors
- **`Provider`**: VM provider-specific operational failures
- **`Io`**: File system and I/O operations (auto-converted from `std::io::Error`)
- **`Command`**: External command execution failures
- **`Dependency`**: Missing system dependencies or tools
- **`Network`**: Network connectivity and remote operation failures
- **`Internal`**: Unexpected internal errors and programming bugs
- **`Filesystem`**: File system operation failures
- **`Serialization`**: YAML/JSON parsing and generation errors

### Error Flow

All errors originate from lower-level crates and flow upward through the dependency chain:

1. **Origin**: Errors occur in foundation or provider layers
2. **Propagation**: Errors bubble up through the call stack as `VmError` variants
3. **Context**: Each layer can add contextual information without changing the error type
4. **Handling**: The application layer (`vm`) provides final error formatting and user feedback

### Implementation Guidelines

- **Use `Result<T>` consistently**: All fallible operations return `Result<T, VmError>`
- **Convert early**: Convert external errors to `VmError` as close to the source as possible
- **Add context**: Use `.map_err()` to add contextual information when propagating errors
- **Fail fast**: Validate inputs early and fail with clear error messages
- **Log appropriately**: Use tracing for debugging while showing user-friendly messages

## Testing Strategy

The layered architecture enables comprehensive testing at multiple levels:

- **Unit Tests**: Each crate includes extensive unit tests for its core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-crate functionality is tested through integration test suites
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflows are tested through the main CLI interface
- **Mock Providers**: Test providers enable testing without external dependencies

## Future Architecture Considerations

The current architecture provides a solid foundation for future enhancements:

- **Plugin System**: The provider abstraction can be extended to support external plugins
- **API Layer**: A REST API layer could be added above the current application layer
- **Event System**: Event-driven architecture could be introduced for better service coordination
- **Metrics Collection**: Centralized metrics and telemetry could be added to the core layer

This architecture balances simplicity with extensibility, providing a maintainable foundation that can evolve with the project's needs.
