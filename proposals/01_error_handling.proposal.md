## Problem

The codebase contains over 750 calls to `.unwrap()`, creating a significant risk of panics in production environments.

## Solution(s)

Systematically replace `.unwrap()` and `.expect()` calls with robust error handling using `Result<T, E>` and the `?` operator. Where appropriate, use `match` statements, `if let`, or functions like `unwrap_or_else` for graceful error recovery or default value provision.

## Checklists

- [ ] Search the entire Rust codebase (`*.rs`) for all occurrences of `.unwrap()`.
- [ ] Search the entire Rust codebase (`*.rs`) for all occurrences of `.expect()`.
- [ ] For each occurrence, analyze the context and replace it with appropriate error handling (`?`, `match`, `if let`, `map_err`, `unwrap_or_else`, etc.).
- [ ] Prioritize replacements in application logic (`src/`) over test code (`tests/`).
- [ ] Ensure all changes are compiled successfully with `cargo check --all-targets`.
- [ ] Run the existing test suite with `cargo test --all-targets` to ensure no regressions are introduced.

## Success Criteria

- The number of `.unwrap()` and `.expect()` calls in the non-test codebase is reduced to zero, or near-zero for justified cases (e.g., unrecoverable state in tests, mutex poisoning).
- All existing tests pass.

## Benefits

- Dramatically improves application stability and reliability.
- Eliminates a major source of production panics.
- Promotes idiomatic Rust error handling.
