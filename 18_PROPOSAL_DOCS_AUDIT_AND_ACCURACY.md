# üìö Documentation Audit & Accuracy Proposal

## Core Objective
Ensure all markdown documentation accurately reflects the current codebase - NO content bloat, just honesty and precision.

## Documentation Philosophy
- **Accuracy First**: Every statement must reflect current code reality
- **Concise & Dense**: Maximum information density, minimum word count
- **Right-sized**: Match detail level to document purpose (README = overview, API docs = specifics)
- **Single Source of Truth**: One canonical location per topic
- **Honesty**: If something doesn't work, say so. If it's experimental, call it out.

## üîç Systematic Review Process

### Phase 1: Discovery & Mapping
1. Read each document completely
2. Map claims to actual code locations
3. Note missing/undocumented features
4. Flag suspicious or vague claims

### Phase 2: Verification
For each document, verify:
- [ ] **API Accuracy** - Function signatures, parameters, return types
- [ ] **CLI Accuracy** - Commands, flags, subcommands match `--help`
- [ ] **Configuration** - All fields in examples are supported
- [ ] **Installation** - Every method works on clean environment
- [ ] **Code Examples** - All snippets compile and execute
- [ ] **File Paths** - Referenced files/directories exist
- [ ] **Feature Claims** - Advertised features are implemented
- [ ] **Error Messages** - Documented errors match actual output
- [ ] **Version Info** - Version numbers are consistent

### Phase 3: Quality Assessment
Rate each document on:
- **Honesty** (1-5): Does it accurately represent reality?
- **Superfluousness** (1-5): Is there unnecessary bloat?
- **Quality** (1-5): Is it well-structured and helpful?

### Phase 4: Remediation
Based on findings:
- Fix factual errors immediately
- Remove unimplemented features
- Consolidate duplicate content
- Add missing critical information
- Delete obsolete documentation

---

## ‚úÖ Update Guidelines

### DO
- Fix incorrect information immediately
- Remove obsolete/deprecated content
- Add only missing critical information
- Test all code examples before documenting
- Use concrete examples over abstract descriptions
- Call out experimental/unstable features explicitly
- Admit known issues and limitations

### DON'T
- Add marketing language or hype
- Document features that don't exist
- Duplicate information across files
- Include verbose explanations
- Make promises about future features
- Hide known bugs or limitations
- Expand content unnecessarily

---

## üìä Audit Output Format

For each document, report:

```markdown
### [DOCUMENT NAME]
**Status**: ‚úÖ Accurate | ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues | ‚ùå Major Issues
**Honesty**: [1-5]/5
**Bloat**: [1-5]/5
**Quality**: [1-5]/5

**Issues Found**:
- Issue 1 (line X): Description
- Issue 2 (line Y): Description

**Recommended Actions**:
- [ ] Action 1
- [ ] Action 2

**Code References**:
- Claim at line X ‚Üí `file.rs:123`
- Feature at line Y ‚Üí Not implemented
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

Documentation is considered accurate when:
- [ ] All installation methods work on clean systems
- [ ] All code examples execute without modification
- [ ] All CLI commands/flags match actual implementation
- [ ] All configuration examples are valid
- [ ] No unimplemented features are documented
- [ ] Known issues are honestly disclosed
- [ ] No duplicate content across files
- [ ] All file paths and line numbers are current
- [ ] Version numbers are consistent everywhere
- [ ] External links are not broken

---

## üöÄ Execution Plan

### Priority Order
1. **README.md** - First impression, must be accurate
2. **docs/getting-started/installation.md** - Critical for onboarding
3. **docs/getting-started/quick-start.md** - Tests real-world experience
4. **docs/user-guide/cli-reference.md** - Most frequently referenced
5. **CLAUDE.md** - Developer productivity
6. **docs/user-guide/configuration.md** - Common troubleshooting source
7. **docs/user-guide/troubleshooting.md** - Direct problem-solving
8. **All remaining docs** - Systematic coverage

### Timeline Estimate
- Discovery: 2-3 hours
- Verification: 4-6 hours
- Remediation: 3-4 hours
- **Total: 9-13 hours**

---

## üìù Notes

- This audit focuses on **accuracy and honesty**, not expansion
- When in doubt, verify against actual code behavior
- Delete documentation for non-existent features
- Consolidate duplicate content into single source
- Proposals should NOT be modified (they are historical)
- Test in clean environments, not development setups

---

**Remember**: Documentation that lies is worse than no documentation. Be ruthless about accuracy.
